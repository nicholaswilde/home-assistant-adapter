Example firmware for the ESP32C3-based Home Assistant adapter
[available from FirstBuild](https://firstbuild.com/inventions/home-assistant-adapter/).

## :package: Hardware

The Home Assistant adapter consists of a
[Xiao ESP32C3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_ESP32C3_Getting_Started/) and
[carrier board](doc/schematic-v1.0.pdf) that breaks out the serial interface of
the Xiao to an RJ45 jack.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Setup

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) and [go-task](https://taskfile.dev).
2. Initialize the project:
   ```bash
   task init
   ```
   This will copy the sample configuration files to `config/Config.h` and `config/Certificate.h` (without overwriting existing custom configs) and configure Git hooks to prevent credentials from being committed.
3. Edit `config/Config.h` with your WiFi credentials, MQTT configuration, and device ID.
4. Edit `config/Certificate.h` to add your certificate (if any).

In-depth instructions can be found in the [Getting Started](doc/getting-started.md) guide.


## :rocket: Usage

### Build

Builds the firmware into `.pio/build/xiao_c3/firmware.bin`.

```bash
task build
```

### Clean

Deletes all build artifacts.

```bash
task clean
```

### Upload

Uploads/flashes the firmware to the ESP32-C3.

```bash
task upload
```

> [!NOTE]
> The board may need to be reset into bootloader mode by holding the B (boot)
> button and pressing the R (reset) button.

### (Serial) Monitor

Opens the PlatformIO serial monitor to view a connected ESP32-C3's serial output.

```bash
task monitor
```
